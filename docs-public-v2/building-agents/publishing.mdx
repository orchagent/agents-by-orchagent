---

Publish your agent or skill to make it available on the platform.

## Prerequisites

1. orchagent account with API key
2. CLI installed and authenticated
3. For agents: `orchagent.json` manifest in your directory
4. For skills: `SKILL.md` file in your directory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to your agent directory
cd my-agent

# Publish as public agent
orch publish --public

# Publish as private agent (default)
orch publish
```

## Visibility & Pricing

orchagent supports both public and private agents/skills, with optional per-call pricing:

| Visibility | Plan | Who Can Access |
|------------|------|----------------|
| **Public** | Free | Anyone with the CLI or API |
| **Private** | Pro | Your workspace only |

### Public (Free)
- Anyone can call your agent via CLI or API
- Great for open-source tools, showcase agents, and team sharing

### Private (Pro)
- Only accessible within your workspace
- Ideal for proprietary tools, internal workflows, or client-specific agents

<Note>
Private agents require a Pro subscription. [Contact us](mailto:hello@orchagent.io) for pricing.
</Note>

### Paid Agents

You can set a per-call price on any agent or skill. Callers pay from their prepaid credit balance.

```bash
# Publish with a price
orch publish --public --price 0.50    # $0.50 per call

# Set pricing on an already-published agent
orch pricing my-agent 0.50
```

Paid agents are **server-only for non-owners** — other users must use `orch run` (cloud, the default). Local execution via `orch run --local` is not available for paid agents. You can still download your own paid agents for testing.

### Source Available vs Server Only

Agents have two visibility modes that control what non-owners can see and do:

| Mode | Prompt/code visible? | `orch run` | `orch fork` | Badge |
|------|---------------------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Source Available** (`--local-download`) | Yes | Yes | Yes | "Source Available" |
| **Server Only** (default) | No — redacted | No — cloud only (`orch run`) | No — blocked | "Server Only" |

**Server-only agents** (the default) redact the prompt, manifest, and skill files from public API responses. This protects your intellectual property while still letting users run the agent via `orch run` (cloud execution).

**Source-available agents** expose the full prompt and code. Users can inspect, fork, and run locally. Use this for open/community agents where transparency builds trust.

Paid agents are always server-only regardless of the `--local-download` flag.

See [Monetization](/concepts/monetization) for full details on pricing, credits, and payouts.

## Publishing Skills

Skills use a simpler format than agents. Create a `SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: react-best-practices
description: React optimization patterns for code review
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: yourname
---

## Rules

- Use functional components over class components
- Memoize expensive computations with useMemo
- ...
```

Then publish:

```bash
cd my-skill

# Publish as private (default)
orch publish

# Publish as public (opt-in)
orch publish --public
```

The CLI auto-detects `SKILL.md` and publishes as a skill. See [Agent Types](/building-agents/agent-types#skills) for the full SKILL.md format.

---

## Publishing Agents

### Step 1: Initialize Your Agent

Create a new agent project:

```bash
# Create prompt-based agent
orch init my-agent --type prompt

# Create agent (LLM with tools in sandbox)
orch init my-agent --type agent

# Create tool (your code, full control)
orch init my-tool --type tool

cd my-agent
```

This creates a directory with the basic structure. Prompt and agent types get `orchagent.json`, `prompt.md`, and `schema.json`. Tools get `orchagent.json` and a `main.py` template.

### Step 2: Configure Your Manifest

Edit `orchagent.json` with your agent's configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-agent",
  "type": "prompt",
  "description": "What my agent does",
  "supported_providers": ["openai", "anthropic"]
}
```

See [Manifest Format](/building-agents/manifest-format) for all options.

### Step 3: Test Locally

Before publishing, test your agent locally:

```bash
# For prompt-based agents
orch run . --input '{"text": "test input"}'

# For tools
orch run .
```

### Step 4: Publish

```bash
# Publish as private (default)
orch publish

# Publish as public (accessible to anyone)
orch publish --public
```

## What Happens on Publish

The platform runs several checks:

1. **Manifest validation** - Verifies `orchagent.json` is valid
2. **Schema validation** - Validates input/output schemas
3. **Dependency check** - Verifies all dependencies exist (for orchestrators)
4. **Cycle detection** - Ensures no circular dependencies

For **agents** (type `"agent"`), the platform also:

1. Stores your `prompt.md` as the agent's system prompt
2. Stores `custom_tools` and `max_turns` from your manifest
3. On each call, spins up an E2B sandbox with an agent runner
4. The runner gives the LLM your prompt, built-in tools, and custom tools
5. The LLM iterates until it calls `submit_result` or hits `max_turns`

For **tools** (type `"tool"`), the platform also:

1. Creates a ZIP bundle of your code
2. Stores the bundle securely
3. On each call, spins up an E2B sandbox
4. Runs your entrypoint with input via stdin
5. Returns stdout as the response

## Versioning

Versions are **automatically assigned** by the server each time you publish. The first publish creates `v1`, the next creates `v2`, and so on.

```
https://api.orchagent.io/yourorg/my-agent/v1/analyze
https://api.orchagent.io/yourorg/my-agent/v2/analyze
```

### How It Works

- **Every `orch publish` creates a new version** - v1, v2, v3, etc.
- **Authors cannot control version numbers** - this is intentional for simplicity
- **All versions remain accessible** - old versions stay available for 60 days after deprecation

### Running a Specific Version

Use the `@version` syntax to pin to a specific version:

```bash
# Run the latest version
orch run yourorg/my-agent

# Run a specific version
orch run yourorg/my-agent@v1
orch run yourorg/my-agent@v2
```

Callers should pin to specific versions for stability in production environments.

## Tool Bundling

For tools, the CLI automatically creates a ZIP bundle of your project.

### Auto-Detection

The CLI detects tool projects by looking for:
- Python files (`.py`) with `requirements.txt`
- JavaScript files (`.js`) with `package.json`

### Entrypoint Detection

The CLI looks for entrypoints in this order:

**Python:** `main.py`, `app.py`, `agent.py`, `run.py`, `__main__.py`

**JavaScript:** `main.js`, `index.js`, `agent.js`, `main.ts`, `index.ts`, `agent.ts`

Override in your manifest:

```json
{
  "entrypoint": "sandbox_main.py"
}
```

### Bundle Exclusions

These files/directories are automatically excluded:

**Python:**
- `**/__pycache__/`, `**/*.pyc`, `**/*.pyo`, `**/*.egg-info/`
- `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`, `.env`
- `dist/`, `build/`, `.eggs/`
- `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`
- `.mypy_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`

**Node.js:**
- `node_modules/`
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lockb`
- `tsconfig.json`

**Git & IDE:**
- `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`
- `.idea/`, `.vscode/`, `.DS_Store`

**Documentation:**
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`
- `docs/`

**Docker & CI:**
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`
- `.github/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`

**Tests:**
- `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`
- `*_test.py`, `test_*.py`, `*.test.js`, `*.spec.ts`
- `conftest.py`, `pytest.ini`, `coverage/`

**Other:**
- `orchagent.json` (read separately)
- `*.zip`, `bundle.zip`
- `scripts/`, `Makefile`

For custom exclusions, add a `bundle` section to your manifest:

```json
{
  "name": "my-agent",
  "bundle": {
    "exclude": ["data/", "*.log"],
    "include": ["important.dat"]
  }
}
```

### Size Limits

- Maximum bundle size: **50MB**
- Keep bundles small for faster cold starts

### Dry Run

Preview your bundle without publishing:

```bash
orch publish --dry-run
```

This shows:
- Files that will be included
- Total bundle size
- Detected entrypoint

## Web UI Upload

You can also upload tool bundles through the web dashboard as an alternative to the CLI.

### Upload via Dashboard

1. Go to [orchagent Dashboard](https://orchagent.io/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Agents** → **My Agents**
3. Click **Upload Bundle** on your agent card
4. Drag and drop your ZIP file or click to select

### Bundle Requirements

When uploading manually, ensure your ZIP contains:
- `orchagent.json` at the root
- Your entrypoint file (`main.py`, etc.)
- `requirements.txt` or `package.json` (if needed)

### Bundle Status

Agent cards show bundle status indicators:
- ✓ **Active** - Bundle uploaded and ready
- ⏳ **Processing** - Bundle being validated
- ✗ **Error** - Bundle validation failed (check logs)

## Service Keys

When you publish an agent that has dependencies, the platform issues a **service key**:

```json
{
  "agent": { "...": "agent fields" },
  "service_key": "sk_agent_...",
  "service_key_prefix": "sk_agent_..."
}
```

<Warning>
Store the service key securely. It's only shown once on registration. Your agent uses this key to call other agents.
</Warning>

Set it as an environment variable for your deployed agent:

```bash
export ORCHAGENT_SERVICE_KEY="sk_agent_..."
```

## Publish Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--public` | Make agent publicly accessible |
| `--private` | (Deprecated) Private is now the default - this flag still works but is no longer needed |
| `--dry-run` | Validate and preview bundle without publishing |
| `--entrypoint <file>` | Override entrypoint for tools |
| `--skills <list>` | Default skills (comma-separated, e.g., `org/skill@v1,org/other@v1`) |
| `--skills-locked` | Lock default skills (callers cannot override via flags) |
| `--price <amount>` | Set per-call price in USD (e.g., `0.50` for $0.50). Requires payout onboarding. |
| `--local-download` | Allow users to download and run locally. Without this flag, agents default to server-only. |

## Distribution

By default, new agents are **server-only** — users run them via `orch run` on orchagent's cloud servers. This is the recommended default for most agents.

To allow users to download and run your agent locally with `orch run --local`:

```bash
# Publish with local download enabled
orch publish --public --local-download
```

You can also toggle this after publishing:

```bash
# Enable local download
orch pricing my-agent free --local-download

# Disable local download (back to server-only)
orch pricing my-agent free --no-local-download
```

<Note>
Paid agents are always server-only. The `--local-download` flag is ignored when pricing is set to `per_call`. Agent owners can always download their own agents regardless of this setting.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### "Manifest validation failed"

Check your `orchagent.json` for:
- Valid JSON syntax
- Required fields present
- Correct field types

### "Dependency not found"

Verify all dependencies in your manifest exist:
- Check org/agent names are correct
- Ensure dependencies are published
- Verify version strings match

### "Bundle too large"

Tool bundles have a 50MB size limit. To reduce size:
- Check for large files that shouldn't be included
- Remove `node_modules/` or `venv/` directories
- Use `bundle.exclude` in your manifest to exclude files

### "Entrypoint not found"

The CLI auto-detects entrypoints: `main.py`, `app.py`, `agent.py`, `run.py` for Python; `main.js`, `index.js`, `agent.js` for JavaScript. If your entrypoint has a different name:

```json
{
  "entrypoint": "sandbox_main.py"
}
```
