description: "Platform credits for running agents"

orchagent uses a credit-based billing system for platform usage. Add credits to your account and they're consumed when you run agents.

## How It Works

```
Sign up → Add credits → Run agents → Credits consumed per call
```

---

## Adding Credits

Add prepaid credits to your account.

```bash
# Add $10 in credits (minimum $5)
orch billing add 10

# Check your balance
orch billing balance

# View transaction history
orch billing history
```

You can also add credits from the dashboard at **Settings > Billing > Add Credits**.

Credits are added via Stripe Checkout. They don't expire and are refundable on request.

## Running Agents

When you run an agent, the platform usage cost is deducted from your credit balance automatically. If your balance is insufficient, you'll get a `402 Payment Required` error.

### Checking Costs

Agent pricing is shown on agent detail pages. You can also check via the public API endpoint:

```http
GET /public/agents/{org}/{agent}/{version}
```

## Access Control

| Download Enabled | `orch run` (cloud, default) | `orch run --local` / install |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| OFF (default) | Anyone | Blocked — cloud only |
| ON | Anyone | Anyone |

New agents default to server-only (`allow_local_download=false`). Authors opt-in to local download via `--local-download` flag or the web UI toggle.

```bash
# Non-owner trying to run a server-only agent locally:
$ orch run --local acme/server-agent
Error: This agent is server-only and cannot be downloaded.
Use: orch run acme/server-agent@latest --data '{...}'

# Owner downloading their own agent (always works):
$ orch run --local acme/my-agent
✔ Downloaded acme/my-agent@latest
```
