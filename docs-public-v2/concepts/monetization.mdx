orchagent charges per execution for platform usage. Authors can also optionally set per-call pricing on their agents — users pay from a prepaid credit balance, and authors receive payouts via Stripe.

## How It Works

```
Author deploys agent → User runs agent → Platform usage tracked → Optional per-call fee → Monthly payout
```

| Role | What You Do |
|------|-------------|
| **User** | Run agents via CLI/API/web, add credits for paid agents |
| **Author** | Deploy agents, optionally set per-call pricing, receive payouts |

---

## For Users

### Adding Credits

Purchase prepaid credits to call paid agents.

```bash
# Add $10 in credits (minimum $5)
orch billing add 10

# Check your balance
orch billing balance

# View transaction history
orch billing history
```

You can also add credits from the dashboard at **Settings > Billing > Add Credits**.

Credits are purchased via Stripe Checkout. They don't expire and are refundable on request.

### Calling Paid Agents

Paid agents work the same as free agents — just use `orch call`:

```bash
orch call acme/premium-agent --data '{"text": "..."}'
```

The call price is deducted from your credit balance automatically. If your balance is insufficient, you'll get a `402 Payment Required` error.

<Note>
Paid agents are **server-only**. You cannot download them with `orch run`. Use `orch call` or the HTTP API.
</Note>

### Checking Costs

Agent pricing is shown on agent detail pages. You can also check via the public API endpoint:

```http
GET /public/agents/{org}/{agent}/{version}
```

## For Authors

### Becoming a Seller

Complete Stripe Connect onboarding to receive payouts for your agents.

```bash
# Start onboarding (opens Stripe)
orch seller onboard

# Check your status
orch seller status

# Open your Stripe Express Dashboard
orch seller dashboard
```

Or visit **Settings > Billing > Become a Seller** in the dashboard.

Stripe handles identity verification, bank account setup, and tax forms. Once verified, your status shows "Payouts Enabled".

### Setting Prices

Set a per-call price on any agent or skill you own.

```bash
# Set pricing on an existing agent
orch pricing my-agent 0.50       # $0.50 per call

# Publish a new agent with pricing
orch publish --price 0.50

# Remove pricing (make free again)
orch pricing my-agent 0
```

**Rules:**
- Minimum price: **$0.01** per call
- Paid agents become **server-only** for other users (you can still download your own for testing)
- Pricing is per call — no subscriptions or one-time purchases

### Revenue Split

| Seller Type | Platform Fee | Author Receives |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Founder** | 7.5% | 92.5% |
| **Standard** | 15% | 85% |
| **Same-author calls** | 0% | N/A (no charge) |

Your fee rate is set at onboarding and locked permanently. Founder rate is available to early adopters who join during the launch period.

**Example:** A $1.00 call with the standard rate:
```
Caller pays:     $1.00
Platform fee:    $0.15 (15%)
Author receives: $0.85
```

When you call your own agents, no fees are charged.

<Note>
Per-transaction fees are rounded up to the nearest cent, so small transactions may show a slightly higher effective rate in the UI. Payouts are calculated using your actual base rate to correct for rounding.
</Note>

### Payouts

Earnings are paid out monthly via Stripe:

- **Schedule:** First Thursday of each month
- **Minimum payout:** $50
- **Method:** Direct to your bank account via Stripe Connect

Below the minimum? Your balance carries over to the next month.

```bash
# View your earnings
orch seller earnings

# Open Stripe Dashboard for payout history and bank details
orch seller dashboard
```

Stripe Express Dashboard handles payout history, bank account management, and tax forms — you don't need to manage any of that in orchagent.

### Downstream Costs

If your orchestrator agent calls other paid agents, **you absorb those costs**. The caller pays one price (yours), and downstream costs come out of your margin.

```
Caller pays your agent: $1.00
  Your agent calls SubAgent A: $0.20  ← you pay this
  Your agent calls SubAgent B: $0.10  ← you pay this
Your net revenue: $1.00 - $0.15 (fee) - $0.30 (deps) = $0.55
```

Set `max_downstream_cents` in your manifest to cap downstream spending:

```json
{
  "pricing": {
    "price_per_call_cents": 100,
    "max_downstream_cents": 50
  }
}
```

The platform validates at publish time that your price covers the worst-case downstream costs after fees. If downstream costs exceed the cap during execution, the call halts with `MAX_DOWNSTREAM_EXCEEDED`.

## Access Control

| Pricing | Download Enabled | `orch call` (server) | `orch run` / install |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Free** | OFF (default) | Anyone | Blocked — use `orch call` |
| **Free** | ON | Anyone | Anyone |
| **Paid** | N/A (forced off) | Anyone (charged) | Owner only |

New agents default to server-only (`allow_local_download=false`). Authors opt-in to local download via `--local-download` flag or the web UI toggle. Paid agents always force local download off.

```bash
# Non-owner trying to download a server-only agent:
$ orch run acme/server-agent
Error: This agent is server-only and cannot be downloaded.
Use: orch call acme/server-agent@latest --data '{...}'

# Non-owner trying to download a paid agent:
$ orch run acme/paid-agent
Error: This agent is paid ($0.50/call) and runs on server only.
Use: orch call acme/paid-agent@latest --data '{...}'

# Owner downloading their own agent (always works):
$ orch run acme/paid-agent
✔ Downloaded acme/paid-agent@latest
```
