---

orchagent is an **AI agent deployment platform**. Build agents in Python, JavaScript, or plain English — deploy them to secure cloud sandboxes — and give your team a URL to run them via CLI, API, or web UI.

## How It Works

### For Developers (Building & Deploying)

```
1. Create agent (prompt + schema, or code)
2. Publish via CLI: orch publish
3. Agent is live — callable via CLI, API, or web UI
4. Team members run it from their workspace
5. See usage, run history, and logs in dashboard
```

### For Teams (Running Agents)

```
1. Get access to your team's workspace
2. Run agents: orch run team/agent-name
3. Or open the web UI — fill a form, click Run
4. Results displayed, logged, and tracked
```

## Agents vs Skills

orchagent hosts two types of things:

| | Agents | Skills |
|---|--------|--------|
| **What they do** | **DO** things (execute tasks) | **TEACH** things (provide knowledge) |
| **Nature** | Active executors | Passive knowledge |
| **Output** | Structured results | Context for AI tools |

**Simple rule:**
- Want AI to **DO** something? Use an **agent** (`orch run`)
- Want AI to **KNOW** something? Use a **skill** (`orch skill install`)
- Want to **DELEGATE** to sub-agents? Export agents (`orch install`)

### Agent Types

| Type | What You Provide | Best For |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Prompt** | Prompt template + input/output schema | Simple tasks (extraction, summarization, classification) |
| **Tool** | Python/JS code | Complex logic (multi-step, tools, external APIs) |
| **Agent** | Prompt + custom tools | Multi-step tool-use workflows in a sandbox |
| **Skill** | SKILL.md file | Coding standards, style guides, domain rules |

Agents are:

- **Stateless** - each call is independent
- **Specific** - one task, done well
- **Callable** - simple API or CLI call

Skills use the industry-standard Agent Skills format (adopted by Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Cursor) and can be installed locally or composed with agents.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Secure sandboxes** | Agents run in isolated E2B sandboxes. No infra to manage. |
| **CLI & API** | Deploy and run agents from terminal or via HTTP API |
| **Web Run UI** | Non-developers run agents via a web form |
| **Team workspaces** | Organize agents by team, control access |
| **Run history** | Every execution is logged with inputs, outputs, duration |
| **[Scheduled runs](/using-agents/scheduling)** | Run agents on a cron schedule or webhook trigger |
| **BYOK model** | Bring your own LLM API keys |
| **Secrets vault** | Store API keys securely in your workspace |
| **Per-call pricing** | Authors can optionally charge per execution |

## BYOK: Bring Your Own Key

orchagent uses a **Bring Your Own Key** model. Developers provide their own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

**Why BYOK:**

- Authors don't pay for others' usage
- No middleman markup on LLM costs
- Direct billing with your LLM provider

<Note>
API keys are separate from subscriptions (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus). You'll need to set up API billing at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
