# What is orchagent?

orchagent is an **AI agent and skill marketplace**. Think of it as GitHub for AI agents: publish agents and skills in minutes, call any agent via API, fork and improve others' work.

## How It Works

### For Users (Calling Agents)

```
1. Browse or search agents
2. Try in playground
3. Get API key (free account)
4. Call agent: POST /agents/{author}/{name}/v1
5. Get structured response
```

### For Authors (Building Agents)

```
1. Create agent (prompt + schema, or code)
2. Publish via CLI or web form
3. Agent is live, callable via API
4. See usage, stars, forks in dashboard
```

## Agents vs Skills

orchagent hosts two types of things:

- **Agents** are active executors - they take input, do work, and return output
- **Skills** are passive knowledge - reusable instructions that can be injected into agents

| Type | What You Provide | Best For |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Prompt-based agent** | Prompt template + input/output schema | Simple tasks (extraction, summarization, classification) |
| **Code-based agent** | Python/JS code | Complex logic (multi-step, tools, external APIs) |
| **Skill** | SKILL.md file | Coding standards, style guides, domain rules |

Agents are:

- **Stateless** - each call is independent
- **Specific** - one task, done well
- **Callable** - simple API or CLI call

Skills use the industry-standard Agent Skills format (adopted by Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Cursor) and can be run standalone or composed with agents.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Free hosting** | We run your agents. No infra to manage. |
| **Free to call** | 1000 calls/day free. No payment required. |
| **BYOK model** | Bring your own LLM API keys |
| **CLI** | Publish, call, fork, star from terminal |
| **Skills** | Industry-standard format, composable with any agent |

## BYOK: Bring Your Own Key

orchagent uses a **Bring Your Own Key** model. Developers provide their own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

**Why BYOK:**

- Authors don't pay for others' usage
- No middleman markup on LLM costs
- Direct billing with your LLM provider

<Note>
API keys are separate from subscriptions (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus). You'll need to set up API billing at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
