---

orchagent is an **AI agent deployment platform**. Build agents in Python, JavaScript, or plain English — deploy them to secure cloud sandboxes — and give your team a URL to run them via CLI, API, or web UI.

## How It Works

### For Developers (Building & Deploying)

```
1. Create agent: orch init my-agent
2. Define behavior (prompt + schema, code, or LLM loop)
3. Publish via CLI: orch publish
4. Agent is live — callable via CLI, API, or web UI
5. Team members run it from their workspace
6. See usage, run history, and logs in dashboard
```

### For Teams (Running Agents)

```
1. Get access to your team's workspace
2. Run agents: orch run team/agent-name
3. Or open the web UI — fill a form, click Run
4. Results displayed, logged, and tracked
```

## Agents vs Skills

orchagent hosts two types of things:

| | Agents | Skills |
|---|--------|--------|
| **What they do** | **DO** things (execute tasks) | **TEACH** things (provide knowledge) |
| **Nature** | Active executors | Passive knowledge |
| **Output** | Structured results | Context for AI tools |

**Simple rule:**
- Want AI to **DO** something? Use an **agent** (`orch run`)
- Want AI to **KNOW** something? Use a **skill** (`orch skill install`)
- Want to **DELEGATE** to sub-agents? Export agents (`orch install`)

### Agent Behavior

The platform infers how to run your agent from what you declare:

| You Declare | What Happens | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Prompt + schema (nothing else) | Single LLM call | Extraction, summarization, classification |
| `loop` config + custom tools | LLM tool-use loop in a sandbox | Multi-step workflows, code fixing, iteration |
| `runtime.command` | Your code runs in a sandbox | Full control, non-LLM tasks, multi-model orchestration |

Agents are:

- **On-demand or always-on** (`run_mode`) — each call is independent, or [deploy as a service](/using-agents/services)
- **Specific** - one task, done well
- **Callable** - simple API or CLI call; optionally callable by other agents

Skills use the industry-standard Agent Skills format (adopted by Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Cursor) and can be installed locally or composed with agents.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Secure sandboxes** | Agents run in isolated E2B sandboxes. No infra to manage. |
| **CLI & API** | Deploy and run agents from terminal or via HTTP API |
| **Web Run UI** | Non-developers run agents via a web form |
| **Team workspaces** | Organize agents by team, control access |
| **Run history** | Every execution is logged with inputs, outputs, duration |
| **[Scheduled runs](/using-agents/scheduling)** | Run agents on a cron schedule or webhook trigger |
| **[Always-on services](/using-agents/services)** | Deploy agents as persistent services (Discord bots, workers) |
| **BYOK model** | Bring your own LLM API keys |
| **Secrets vault** | Store API keys securely in your workspace |

## BYOK: Bring Your Own Key

orchagent uses a **Bring Your Own Key** model. Developers provide their own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

**Why BYOK:**

- Authors don't pay for others' usage
- No middleman markup on LLM costs
- Direct billing with your LLM provider

<Note>
API keys are separate from subscriptions (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus). You'll need to set up API billing at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
