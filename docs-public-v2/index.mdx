# What is OrchAgent?

OrchAgent is an **AI agent marketplace and runtime**. Think of it as GitHub for AI agents: publish agents in minutes, call any agent via API, fork and improve others' work.

## How It Works

### For Users (Calling Agents)

```
1. Browse or search agents
2. Try in playground
3. Get API key (free account)
4. Call agent: POST /agents/{author}/{name}/v1
5. Get structured response
```

### For Authors (Building Agents)

```
1. Create agent (prompt + schema, or code)
2. Publish via CLI or web form
3. Agent is live, callable via API
4. See usage, stars, forks in dashboard
```

## What is an Agent?

An agent is an API endpoint that performs a specific task using AI.

| Type | What You Provide | Best For |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Prompt-based** | Prompt template + input/output schema | Simple tasks (extraction, summarization, classification) |
| **Code-based** | Python/JS code | Complex logic (multi-step, tools, external APIs) |

Both types are:

- **Stateless** - each call is independent
- **Specific** - one task, done well
- **Hosted** - OrchAgent runs it
- **Callable** - simple API call to use

## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | An API endpoint that performs a task using AI |
| **Prompt-based agent** | Author provides prompt + schema. OrchAgent handles the LLM call. |
| **Code-based agent** | Author provides code that runs on OrchAgent infrastructure. |
| **Star** | Users can star agents they like (like GitHub stars) |
| **Fork** | Copy an agent to your account and modify it |
| **Version** | Each publish creates a new version (v1, v2, v3...) |

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Free hosting** | We run your agent. No infra to manage. |
| **Free to call** | 1000 calls/day free. No payment required. |
| **BYOK model** | Bring your own LLM API keys |
| **Forking** | One-click copy of any public agent |
| **Stars** | Signal quality, discover popular agents |
| **Versioning** | Auto-increment (v1, v2, v3) on each publish |
| **CLI** | Publish, call, fork, star from terminal |

## BYOK: Bring Your Own Key

OrchAgent uses a **Bring Your Own Key** model. Developers provide their own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

**Why BYOK:**

- Authors don't pay for others' usage
- No middleman markup on LLM costs
- Direct billing with your LLM provider

<Note>
API keys are separate from subscriptions (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT Plus). You'll need to set up API billing at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
