# orchagent

> AI agent deployment platform. Build agents, deploy to secure cloud sandboxes, run via CLI, API, or web UI. BYOK model - you bring your own LLM keys.

## Overview

orchagent is a deployment platform where developers build, deploy, and run AI agents for their teams. Deploy your AI agent. Your team can use it.

**Key features:**
- Build agents in Python/JS or plain English (prompt-based)
- Deploy to secure E2B cloud sandboxes
- Run via CLI, HTTP API, or web UI
- Team workspaces with access control
- Run history, scheduling, and managed secrets
- Always-on services for long-running agents (Discord bots, workers)
- Free tier: 1000 calls/day
- BYOK: Bring your own LLM API keys
- Credit-based billing for platform usage

## Object Types

orchagent has two object types: **agents** (deployable executors) and **skills** (passive knowledge).

**Agents** (`type: "agent"`) are the primary deployable artifact. The platform infers execution behavior from what you declare:
- **Direct LLM**: prompt + schema only → single LLM call (execution engine: `direct_llm`)
- **Managed Loop**: `loop` config + custom tools → LLM tool-use loop in a sandbox (execution engine: `managed_loop`)
- **Code Runtime**: `runtime.command` → your code runs in a sandbox (execution engine: `code_runtime`)

Additional agent fields:
- `run_mode`: `on_demand` (default) or `always_on` (for services)
- `callable`: `true` to expose as a dependency for other agents

**Skills** (`type: "skill"`) are passive knowledge (markdown) that enhances agents.

## API

- Base URL: https://api.orchagent.io
- Auth: Bearer token (API key from dashboard)
- OpenAPI spec: https://docs.orchagent.io/api-reference/openapi.json

## Quick Start

### Deploy an agent
```bash
npm install -g @orchagent/cli
orch login
orch init my-agent
cd my-agent
# Edit prompt.md and schema.json
orch publish
```

### Run an agent (cloud execution, default)
```bash
orch run yourorg/my-agent --data '{"text": "Your text here"}'
```

### Pull a published agent into a local project
```bash
orch pull acme/my-agent@v2 --output ./my-agent
```

### Fork a public agent into your workspace
```bash
orch fork orchagent/my-discord-agent --workspace acme-corp
```

### Run locally (no account needed, --local flag)
```bash
npx @orchagent/cli run orchagent/summarizer --input '{"text": "Your text here"}'
```

### API call
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.orchagent.io/acme/summarizer/v1/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORCHAGENT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your text here"}'
```

## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Agent | A deployed unit that performs a task (`type: "agent"`) |
| Skill | Passive knowledge (markdown) that enhances agents (`type: "skill"`) |
| Direct LLM | Agent with just prompt + schema; single LLM call (`execution_engine: direct_llm`) |
| Managed Loop | Agent with `loop` config; LLM tool-use loop in sandbox (`execution_engine: managed_loop`) |
| Code Runtime | Agent with `runtime.command`; your code runs in sandbox (`execution_engine: code_runtime`) |
| run_mode | `on_demand` (default) or `always_on` (for persistent services) |
| callable | When `true`, other agents can call this agent as a dependency |
| Orchestrator | An agent that calls other agents |
| Workspace | Team-scoped container for agents, members, and settings |
| BYOK | Bring Your Own Key - users provide their own LLM API keys |
| Version | Each publish creates a new version (v1, v2, v3...) |
| Schedule | Cron or webhook trigger that runs an agent automatically |
| Service | Always-on deployment of an agent (Discord bot, worker, listener) |
| Credits | Prepaid balance for platform usage |
