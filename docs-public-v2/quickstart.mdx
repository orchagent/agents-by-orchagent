Build an agent, deploy it, and run it — all from your terminal.

<Tip>
orchagent hosts both **agents** (active executors) and **skills** (passive knowledge). The commands below work for both. See [Agent Types](/building-agents/agent-types) for the difference.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Set up an LLM API key in your environment:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

<Note>
API keys are separate from subscriptions. If you use Claude Pro/Max or ChatGPT Plus, you'll need to set up API billing separately at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
</Note>

## Step 1: Install CLI & Sign Up

```bash
npm install -g @orchagent/cli
```

Go to [orchagent.io](https://orchagent.io) and create a free account, then authenticate:

```bash
orchagent login
```

### Verify Setup (Optional)

```bash
orchagent doctor
```

This checks your environment, config, and connectivity. If everything shows green checkmarks, you're ready to go.

## Step 2: Create an Agent

Initialize a new agent project:

```bash
orch init my-agent --type prompt
cd my-agent
```

This creates:
- `orchagent.json` — agent manifest
- `prompt.md` — your prompt template
- `schema.json` — input/output schemas

Edit `prompt.md` with your prompt and `schema.json` with your input/output definitions.

## Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
orch run . --local --input '{"text": "test input"}'
```

This runs the agent on your machine using your local LLM keys.

## Step 4: Publish

```bash
orch publish
```

Your agent is now live and runnable by your team.

## Step 5: Run It

```bash
# Via CLI
orchagent run yourorg/my-agent --data '{"text": "hello world"}'

# Or your team can use the web UI at orchagent.io
```

## Try a Deployed Agent

Want to see the platform in action first? Run one of our showcase agents:

### Run Locally (No Account Needed)

```bash
npx @orchagent/cli run --local orchagent/secrets-scanner https://github.com/your/repo
```

### Run on Server

```bash
orchagent run orchagent/secrets-scanner https://github.com/your/repo
```

## Quick Reference

| Command | What It Does | Where It Runs |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| `orch run <agent>` | Execute agent | Cloud (E2B sandbox) by default |
| `orch run --local <agent>` | Download and execute agent locally | Your machine |
| `orch install <agent>` | Export agent as sub-agent for AI tools | Local files |
| `orch skill install <skill>` | Download skill files for AI tools | Local files |
| `orch update` | Update installed agents to latest | - |
| `orch formats` | List available export formats | - |

### When to Use What

```
Want AI to DO something now?
  |-- Need it local/private? --> orch run --local
  \-- Want managed infra?    --> orch run

Want AI to KNOW something?
  \-- Download knowledge     --> orch skill install

Want to DELEGATE to sub-agents?
  \-- Export for AI tools    --> orch install
```

## Running with Files

Many agents process files. Pass a file as an argument or use the `--file` flag:

```bash
# Tools: pass file as argument (uploaded to sandbox)
orchagent run acme/invoice-scanner invoice.pdf

# Prompt agents: use --file (content is read and mapped to input schema)
orchagent run acme/useeffect-checker --file src/App.tsx

# Pipe file to stdin
cat document.pdf | orchagent run acme/pdf-parser
```

## Running with JSON

For prompt-based agents that accept JSON input:

```bash
# Inline JSON
orchagent run acme/text-extractor --data '{"text":"hello world"}'

# JSON from file
orchagent run acme/text-extractor --data @input.json
```
