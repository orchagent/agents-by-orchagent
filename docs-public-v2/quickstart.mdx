Get started with orchagent in two ways: run agents locally (no account needed) or on our servers (free account required).

<Tip>
orchagent hosts both **agents** (active executors) and **skills** (passive knowledge). The commands below work for both. See [Agent Types](/building-agents/agent-types) for the difference.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Set up an LLM API key in your environment:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

<Note>
API keys are separate from subscriptions. If you use Claude Pro/Max or ChatGPT Plus, you'll need to set up API billing separately at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
</Note>

## Option 1: Run Locally (No Account)

Run an agent on your machine with a single command:

```bash
npx @orchagent/cli run orchagent/secrets-scanner https://github.com/your/repo

# Output:
# {
#   "findings": [...],
#   "summary": "Found 2 potential secrets in 47 files"
# }
```

**What happens:**

1. CLI downloads agent code from our registry
2. Agent runs locally on your machine
3. Agent calls LLM API using your key
4. Results returned to terminal

## Option 2: Run on Server (Free Account)

Run agents on orchagent's servers with more features.

### Step 1: Sign Up

Go to [orchagent.io](https://orchagent.io) and create a free account.

### Step 2: Install CLI

```bash
npm install -g @orchagent/cli
```

### Step 3: Login

```bash
orchagent login
```

This opens your browser for authentication and stores your API key.

### Step 4: Verify Setup (Optional)

```bash
orchagent doctor
```

This checks your environment, config, and connectivity. If everything shows green checkmarks, you're ready to go.

### Step 5: Call an Agent

```bash
orchagent call orchagent/secrets-scanner https://github.com/your/repo

# Output:
# {
#   "findings": [...],
#   "summary": "Found 2 potential secrets in 47 files"
# }
```

**What happens:**

1. CLI sends request to gateway (api.orchagent.io)
2. Gateway routes to agent container
3. Agent processes request and returns results

## Quick Reference

| Command | What It Does | Where It Runs |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| `orch run <agent>` | Download and execute agent locally | Your machine |
| `orch call <agent>` | Execute agent via API | Cloud (E2B sandbox) |
| `orch install <agent>` | Export agent as sub-agent for AI tools | Local files |
| `orch skill install <skill>` | Download skill files for AI tools | Local files |
| `orch update` | Update installed agents to latest | - |
| `orch formats` | List available export formats | - |

### When to Use What

```
Want AI to DO something now?
  ├─ Need it local/private? → orch run
  └─ Want managed infra?    → orch call

Want AI to KNOW something?
  └─ Download knowledge     → orch skill install

Want to DELEGATE to sub-agents?
  └─ Export for AI tools    → orch install
```

## Calling with Files

Many agents process files. Pass a file as the second argument:

```bash
# Call with a PDF file
orchagent call acme/invoice-scanner invoice.pdf

# Pipe file to stdin
cat document.pdf | orchagent call acme/pdf-parser
```

## Calling with JSON

For prompt-based agents that accept JSON input:

```bash
# Inline JSON
orchagent call acme/text-extractor --data '{"text":"hello world"}'

# JSON from file
orchagent call acme/text-extractor --data @input.json
```
