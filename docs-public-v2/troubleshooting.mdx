## First Step: Run Doctor

Before diving into specific errors, run the diagnostic command:

```bash
orchagent doctor
```

This checks your environment, configuration, connectivity, authentication, and LLM setup. Most issues are caught here with actionable fix suggestions.

## CLI Errors

### "Agent exited with code X (no output)"

The agent process terminated without producing any output. Common causes:

- **Missing dependency** - Check your `requirements.txt` has all required packages
- **Syntax error in entrypoint** - Python couldn't parse your code
- **Agent crashed before writing output** - Check for exceptions in your code

**Solutions:**
1. Run with `--verbose` flag for more details: `orch run myagent --verbose`
2. Test locally: `python sandbox_main.py < input.json`
3. Check agent logs in the [dashboard](https://orchagent.io/dashboard)

### "Failed to extract bundle"

The downloaded agent bundle couldn't be extracted. This usually means:
- The bundle file is corrupted
- The agent was published incorrectly

**Solution:** Re-publish the agent with `orch publish`

### "No LLM key found"

The agent requires an LLM provider but no API key is available.

**Solutions:**
- **For local execution (`orch run --local`)**: Set environment variable:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  # or
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
  ```
- **For cloud execution (`orch run`, the default)**: Add key in [Settings → LLM Keys](https://orchagent.io/settings)

## API / Server Errors

### "Sandbox execution failed" / "Code execution failed"

The E2B sandbox couldn't run your agent code.

**Common causes:**
- Agent code has a syntax error
- Missing dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Timeout exceeded (default: 60 seconds)
- Agent crashed without output

**Solutions:**
1. Test locally first with `orch run`
2. Check agent logs in the [dashboard](https://orchagent.io/dashboard)
3. Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`

### "Failed to decrypt LLM key"

Your stored LLM API key couldn't be decrypted. This can happen if the server's encryption key was rotated.

**Solution:** Delete and re-add your LLM key in [Settings → LLM API Keys](https://orchagent.io/settings)

### "Agent not found" (404)

The agent doesn't exist or you used the wrong format.

**Solutions:**
- Use full format: `orchagent/leak-finder` not just `leak-finder`
- Check spelling and version: `orch info orchagent/leak-finder`

### "Authentication error" (401)

Your API key is invalid or expired.

**Solution:** Run `orch login` to re-authenticate

### "Rate limit exceeded" (429)

You've exceeded the API rate limit.

**Solution:** Wait a moment and retry. See [Rate Limits](/concepts/rate-limits) for details.

## Service Errors

### Service stuck in provisioning

The Cloud Run service hasn't become healthy yet.

**Solutions:**
1. Check the events timeline: `orch service info <service-id>`
2. Verify your agent has a `runtime.command` or `loop` config with a published code bundle (direct LLM agents cannot be deployed as services)
3. Check logs for dependency installation failures: `orch service logs <service-id>`

### Service keeps restarting

The agent process is crashing repeatedly.

**Solutions:**
1. Check the logs for crash output: `orch service logs <service-id>`
2. Look at the last error: `orch service info <service-id>`
3. Ensure all required secrets are configured in your workspace
4. Verify your entrypoint process doesn't exit immediately
5. Your code must **not** bind to port 8080 — the health server uses it

### CRASH-LOOP badge showing

The service was auto-paused after exceeding the consecutive failure threshold.

**Solutions:**
1. Fix the root cause (code bug, missing secret, dependency issue)
2. Restart the service: `orch service restart <service-id>`
3. Check the events timeline: `orch service info <service-id>`

### "No entrypoint found" error

The service runner couldn't detect which file to run.

**Solutions:**
- Add a `main.py` or `index.js` to your project root
- Or set a `run_command` in your `orchagent.json`
- Or use `--command` when deploying

## Schedule Errors

### Schedule not executing

**Solutions:**
- Check that the schedule is enabled: `orch schedule list`
- Verify your LLM keys are configured in the workspace
- Try a manual trigger to see the error: `orch schedule trigger <id>`

### Schedule auto-disabled

The schedule hit its consecutive failure threshold and was automatically paused.

**Solutions:**
1. Check recent failures: `orch schedule info <id>`
2. Fix the root cause
3. Re-enable: `orch schedule update <id> --enable`

---

## Dashboard Errors

If you see an error toast in the dashboard:
- The toast message shows the actual error from the server
- Common issues: network connectivity, expired session, invalid input

**Solution:** Try refreshing the page. If the issue persists, check the browser console for details.
