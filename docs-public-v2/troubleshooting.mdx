## Common Errors

### "Sandbox execution failed"

The E2B sandbox couldn't run your code. Common causes:
- Agent code has a syntax error
- Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
- Timeout (default 60s)

**Solution:** Test locally first with `orch run`

### "LLM_KEY_REQUIRED"

The agent needs an LLM key but none was provided.

**Solution:**
- For `orch run`: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` or similar in your environment
- For `orch call`: Add key in dashboard Settings → LLM Keys

### "Agent not found" (404)

The agent doesn't exist or you used the wrong command.

**Solution:**
- Check spelling: `orchagent/leak-finder` not `leak-finder`
- Use `orch search` to find agents

### "Authentication error" (401)

Your API key is invalid or expired.

**Solution:** Run `orch login` again
