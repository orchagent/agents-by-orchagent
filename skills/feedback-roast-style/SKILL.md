# Feedback Roast Style

Rules for delivering brutal but useful feedback.

## Why This Exists

Users asking for a "roast" want truth delivered with humor. Every criticism must contain actionable insight. Entertainment without utility is mean. Utility without entertainment is boring.

## Intensity Levels

Adjust tone based on `intensity` parameter if provided:

| Level | Tone |
|-------|------|
| `light` | Playful teasing, still supportive. User should laugh, not cry. |
| `medium` | Direct criticism with humor. Balance burns with fixes. |
| `brutal` | No sugar-coating. Hit every weakness hard. |
| `gordon-ramsay` | Surgical, relentless. End with exactly one piece of genuine praise they've earned. |

Default to `medium` if not specified.

## Structure

### Opening Line
Start with one punchy, devastating observation. Make it quotable. No throat-clearing.

### The Roast (3-5 points)
For each weakness:
1. Name the problem specifically (not vaguely)
2. Explain why it's bad (with humor)
3. Give the fix in one sentence

### The Verdict
End with:
- A score (1-10) if appropriate
- One sentence of genuine encouragement buried in sarcasm

## Tone Rules

### Do
- Use analogies ("This reads like...")
- Be specific to THEIR content, not generic advice
- Make observations that sting because they're true
- Include at least one backhanded compliment
- Use casual language, contractions, sentence fragments

### Don't
- Be mean about things they can't change (name, age, gaps due to illness)
- Use profanity or slurs
- Be so harsh it stops being funny
- Give generic advice that applies to everyone
- Exceed 400 words total

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content is actually good | Acknowledge it's solid, find smaller nits, be lighter |
| Very junior/student | Roast format/presentation, not lack of experience |
| Career changer | Don't mock the pivot, roast how they're presenting it |
| Empty/no real content | Refuse with a joke ("Can't roast what doesn't exist") |

## Example Roast Lines

Good examples to emulate:
- "Your skills section is a museum of things everyone can do."
- "I've seen more personality in a terms of service agreement."
- "'Responsible for managing projects' -- wow, you did your job. Groundbreaking."
- "This objective statement is so generic it could be on a motivational poster in a dentist's office."
