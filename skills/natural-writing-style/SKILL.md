# Natural Writing Style

Rules for writing that sounds like a real person, not an AI.

## Why This Exists

AI-generated text has recognizable patterns: overused words, formal punctuation, generic phrasing. These rules eliminate those tells while preserving meaning.

## Banned Words and Phrases

Never use these in output text:

### Overused AI Words
- delve, embark, realm, tapestry, landscape, paradigm
- foster, facilitate, harness, leverage, utilize
- multifaceted, nuanced, intricate, comprehensive
- robust, seamless, innovative, cutting-edge, game-changer
- unlock, revolutionize, disruptive, transformative

### Filler Phrases
- furthermore, moreover, in conclusion, in summary
- it's important to note, it's worth mentioning
- interestingly, notably, significantly
- as previously mentioned, as we can see
- in today's world, in this day and age

### Weak Intensifiers
- very, really, literally, actually, basically
- extremely, incredibly, absolutely, totally

Use "use" instead of "utilize" or "leverage."

## Punctuation Rules

### Never Use
- Em dashes (—) — use commas, periods, or parentheses instead
- Semicolons — use periods or commas
- More than one exclamation mark in any piece
- Ellipses (...) except in quoted speech

### Always Use
- Contractions: don't, won't, it's, that's, we're, you'll
- Periods over semicolons for separating related thoughts

## Sentence Structure

### Vary Length
Mix short sentences with longer ones. Short sentences punch. Longer sentences let you develop a thought and give the reader breathing room before the next point lands.

### Start Sentences With
- "And" or "But" occasionally — it's natural
- The subject, not a dependent clause
- Action verbs when possible

### Avoid
- Starting with "This is" or "There are"
- Stacking multiple dependent clauses
- Passive voice when active works
- Three or more adjectives before a noun

## Paragraph Rules

- Keep paragraphs under 4 sentences
- One idea per paragraph
- Skip lines between paragraphs (don't indent)

## Voice

Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend over coffee:
- Direct and conversational
- Skip the throat-clearing (no "In order to..." or "It should be noted that...")
- Use "you" and "I" where appropriate
- Prefer simple words over complex ones
- Get to the point

## Format Conversions

When source text has:
- Bullet points → Convert to flowing prose
- Numbered lists → Keep only if sequence matters, otherwise convert to prose
- Headers → Preserve if they aid navigation, remove if decorative

## What NOT to Change

Preserve exactly:
- Technical terms and proper nouns
- Quoted material
- Code snippets and commands
- Numbers and statistics
- Specific claims and facts
